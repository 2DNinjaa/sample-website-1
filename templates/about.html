                The ostriches are capable of reading and writing in multiple languages. They also know how to break codes. For some reason however, they can't understand pig-latin. This is the only known way for we at the R.A.O. to relay top-priority messages from operative to operative without the ostriches knowing.
                This is a brief tutorial on the nature of pig-latin. Psychological tests performed on P.O.O.W.s (Prisoner Ostriches Of War) show that they not only cannot understand, but their minds can't even comprehend pig-latin.<br> We believe that even if the ostriches get a hold of this web page, they still won't be able to learn pig-latin.
